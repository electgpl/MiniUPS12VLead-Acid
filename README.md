# Mini UPS 12V Lead-Acid | UVP Protector - Buck - Charger - Bypass

This project implements a **mini uninterruptible power supply (UPS)** designed for **12V Lead-Acid AGM/GEL batteries**.  
It integrates a dedicated **CN3767 lead-acid charger**, a **PMOS + Schottky bypass circuit**, a **TPS54360 buck regulator**, and an **undervoltage protection (UVP)** stage to ensure safe battery operation.  

The design focuses on maintaining stable 12V output while protecting the battery from undervoltage damage and ensuring correct charging cycles.

## üîë Features

- **Battery chemistry supported:** 12V Lead-Acid (AGM, GEL).  
- **CN3767-based lead-acid charger** with constant-current/constant-voltage (CC/CV) charging.  
- **Bypass system:**  
  - PMOS + Schottky switch circuit.  
  - During charging, disconnects the battery from the load to allow proper charging.  
  - The load is powered instead by a regulated buck supply.  
- **Buck regulator stage:**  
  - Based on **TPS54360** DC/DC converter.  
  - Configured to **13.8V output** for stable system powering during battery charge.  
- **Undervoltage protection (UVP):**  
  - Implemented with **LM393 comparator** and **TL431 reference**.  
  - Controls a **back-to-back PMOS switch**.  
  - Cuts off the battery when voltage falls below **11V**.  
  - Latch-off behavior: system remains disconnected until external power is restored.  
- **2-layer PCB**, designed for compact size, thermal management, and robust operation.
